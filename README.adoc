* DukeCode is a desktop application to auto-grade Data Structure & Algorithms problems. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for students learning Data Structure & Algorithms to practice their coding skills.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
